There are a few possible solutions that you can try to fix the microphone noise issue on your Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS system with an HDA Intel HDMI card. Here are some suggestions:

1. One solution that has worked for some users is to edit the GRUB configuration file. You can do this by opening a terminal and typing `sudo nano /etc/default/grub`. Then, change the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on,igfx_off"`. After saving the file, run `sudo update-grub` and reboot your system ¹.

2. Another solution that has worked for some users is to toggle off UEFI/BIOS settings for virtualization support on their motherboard ¹.

3. If these solutions do not work, you may want to try killing pulseaudio by running `pulseaudio -k` in a terminal, then checking if your laptop uses snd_hda_intel by running `lsmod | grep snd_hda_intel`. If it does, you can run the following command: `echo "options snd-hda-intel model=generic" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf`. After this, you may need to switch off and switch on your laptop, as a simple reboot may not be enough ².

I hope one of these solutions helps you fix the microphone noise issue on your Ubuntu system!

Sure, I can provide you with a list of potential solutions to troubleshoot your microphone issue on Ubuntu. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Check Sound Settings**: Ensure that the correct microphone is selected in the sound settings. Go to `Settings > Sound > Input` and select the correct device. Also, check the input volume level.

2. **Install PulseAudio Volume Control**: PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, including Linux. It's a powerful tool for managing your audio settings. You can install it using the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
    ```
   After installation, open PulseAudio Volume Control (`pavucontrol` in terminal). Under the `Input Devices` tab, check if the correct microphone is selected and adjust the volume.

3. **Update Your System**: Make sure your system is up-to-date. This can be done by running the following commands in the terminal:
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

4. **Reinstall ALSA and PulseAudio**: ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is a software framework and part of the Linux kernel that provides an API for sound card drivers. You can try reinstalling ALSA and PulseAudio using the following commands:
    ```
    sudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio
    sudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio
    ```
   And then, force reload ALSA:
    ```
    sudo alsa force-reload
    ```

5. **Check for Hardware Issues**: Since your microphone works fine on Windows 10, it's unlikely to be a hardware issue. However, it's still worth checking if there's any physical damage or if the microphone is properly connected.

6. **Check for Driver Issues**: It's possible that the drivers for your microphone are not properly installed or are outdated. You can check for driver updates in the `Software & Updates > Additional Drivers` tab.

7. **Check Microphone Permissions**: Ensure that your system has the necessary permissions to access the microphone. You can check this in `Settings > Privacy > Microphone`.

Remember to restart your system after making these changes to ensure they take effect. If none of these solutions work, it might be a more complex issue that requires further troubleshooting.

To troubleshoot the microphone issue in Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, you can try the following solutions:

1. Check microphone settings:
   - Open the Sound Settings by clicking on the speaker icon in the top panel and selecting "Sound Settings."
   - Ensure that the correct input device is selected under the "Input" tab.
   - Adjust the input volume and test the microphone to see if the noise persists.

2. Install and use PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol):
   - Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following command to install pavucontrol:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
     ```
   - Launch pavucontrol by running the command `pavucontrol` in the terminal or searching for "PulseAudio Volume Control" in the applications menu.
   - In the "Input Devices" tab, check if the microphone is listed and adjust its settings if necessary.

3. Disable microphone boost:
   - In the PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) window, locate the microphone input device and click on the "Input Devices" tab.
   - Uncheck the "Boost" option if it's enabled, as it may amplify background noise.
   - Test the microphone again to see if the issue persists.

4. Update audio drivers:
   - Ensure that your Ubuntu system is up to date by running the following commands in a terminal:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```
   - Reboot your system to ensure any kernel updates take effect.
   - Test the microphone after the update to see if the issue has been resolved.

5. Check for conflicting applications:
   - Make sure that no other applications are using the microphone simultaneously, as they might cause conflicts and noise.
   - Close any unnecessary applications that might be accessing the microphone and test it again.

6. Adjust microphone settings in AlsaMixer:
   - Open a terminal and run the command `alsamixer`.
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate to the microphone settings and ensure they are not muted or set to a very low volume.
   - Press the "M" key to unmute/mute a channel and use the arrow keys to adjust the volume levels.
   - Test the microphone to see if the issue persists.

7. Try a different microphone:
   - If possible, test your system with a different microphone to determine if the issue lies with the hardware or the software.

If none of the above solutions resolve the microphone issue, you can search for your specific microphone model along with "Ubuntu" on search engines or forums to see if other users have encountered similar problems and found additional solutions.
