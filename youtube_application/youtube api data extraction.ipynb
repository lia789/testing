      "Hi, I'm Giles McMullen-Klein. My degree was in physics. I've been using python as a scientist for years. I learnt to code whilst studying physics and now I spend most of my time using python to analyse data. Python is an excellent language for data science and on this channel I teach the basics of python and how to use it to work with data. \n",
