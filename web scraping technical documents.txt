This document about technical details about Web Scraping,
it will be used building freelance project catalogs like 🖐️:
	➡️ "DATA SCRAPING"
	➡️ "SCRIPT"
	➡️ "DESKTOP APPLICATION"
	➡️ "WEB APPLICATION"
"""


⬜️ What is the goal of this document❓️
This document will be used inherit web scraping component on different project catalogs.





⬜️ How do identify web scraping design pattern❓️
	👉️ Check website type (static or dynamic) with "Disable JavaScript"
	👉️ Find out "Hidden API" if any thing out there with chrome developer "network" tab
	👉️ Identify bot detect technology behind website with "Wappalyzer"
	👉️ View captcha result with website testing tools ("https://tools.pingdom.com/", "https://gtmetrix.com/", "https://tools.keycdn.com/speed")
	👉️ Find out project pattern combine (optional)
	👉️ Write down pattern type of "Design Document"
	
	➡️ List of web scraping design pattern we have:
		♊️ Static Website
		♊️ Hidden API
		♊️ Simple Dynamic Website
		♊️ Hard Dynamic Website with Playwright
		♊️ Headless 3rd party API
		♊️ Combination of Multiple Pattern
		
	

	

⬜️ What are steps about building Scrapy project❓️
