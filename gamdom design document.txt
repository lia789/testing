Hello, i'd like to ask you If there is any possibility to make my thought funcitonal.
I would like at web https://streamelements.com/casinodaddy/store/
to make a simple bot, that will check the "Sold Out" quantity on "Gamdom gift cards" in the store and whenever it changes to f.e.: 10 items left, It would send me on discord API notification, that the store has been restocked.
Thank you very much!


I'd like just a constant for example 30 minutes checker, that will check the quantity of particular item. I have no problem of running some script 24/7, but I have no idea about programming, so the setup would be completely up to you, just to give me the exact result. I am sorry If i misunderstood your message! Thank you

Exactly. In real world situation, it is usualy out of stock, so whenever the number increases, it is restock, but i assume you already got this points :-D
