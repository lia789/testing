""" this document about building data scraping project 🖐️ """


⬜️ What steps to follow building a data scraping project❓️
	1️⃣️ Do feasibility study and understand data requirements
	2️⃣️ Write proposal with application core feature
	3️⃣️ Convert prospect into sales, and collect project building materials
	4️⃣️ Building "Vision Document 📃️"
	5️⃣️ Build sample CSV file as delivery level prototype and validate
	6️⃣️ Write "Design Document 📃️"
	7️⃣️ Build solution based on design document Milestone 🖥️
	8️⃣️ Handover and close project






⬜️ What about communication with client and asking questions❓️
This is tricky part only communication and business skills save pus to convert prospect into sales.
This is list of goals about initial communication with client:
	➡️ Consult client and uncover client true requirements
	➡️ Convert prospect to sales
	➡️ Collect project building technical materials

I should ask questions based on this topics:
	➡️ Business Goal
	➡️ System User
	➡️ Core Data Requirements
	➡️ Web Scraping Meta Data
	➡️ Data Structure
	
	



⬜️ How to build "Vision Document" for a project❓️
Vision document is base band about building high quality solutions.

Steps about building a Vision document:
	👉️ Make sure, you won the project
	👉️ Create a GitHub repository
	👉️ Copy "Vision Document" templates
	👉️ Write down project meta data
	👉️ Process requirements
		➡️ organize existing important document
		➡️ write data collection business goal
		➡️ work with domain knowledge and constrain
		➡️ write project delivery process and materials
		
Project and Client meta data component ✋️:
	♊️ title
	♊️ price
	♊️ deadline
	♊️ project_name
	♊️ client_name
	♊️ client_designation
	♊️ country
	♊️ time_deference
	♊️ client_technical_expertise
	♊️ data_type
	
Possible component about requirements processing ✋️:
	♊️ existing_important_document
	♊️ data_business_goals
	♊️ domain_knowledge and constrain
	♊️ project_delivery_materials







⬜️ How to build "Design Document"❓️
Building Design document means doing all hard word, raw coding and brain storming inside this part...
Based on "Design Document" milestone full solution will build, it insure easy and high quality solution building process.

Steps about building a Design document:
	👉️ Make sure You have Vision Document and sample CSV file
	👉️ Write important project meta data
	👉️ Write high level design component
			➡️ Write project delivery process and materials
			➡️ Identify web scraping design pattern and write down website security structure
			➡️ Organize technical parts and ideal components, that need repeatedly in iterative mode
	👉️ Inherit web scraping design pattern components
	👉️ Write milestone task for building the solution

Design document project meta data components:
	♊️ project_name
	♊️ price
	♊️ deadline

High level design components:
	♊️ project_delivery_process
	♊️ web_scraping_design_pattern
	♊️ website_security_description
	
	



⬜️ What are common milestone task❓️
	➡️ Write XPATH code on Jupyter lab
	➡️ Setup Scrapy project
	➡️ Run spider and collect data
	➡️ Build data overview report
	➡️ Handover project with materials
